Our coins is officially born on 10 June 2021 by Abhay Gupta at Abhay's new house(just next to mine ). 
Earlier, in 2021, our group is known by thename Notes. As its name suggest it was created to share notes 
for exams. But later it was found that the group was never used for notes after a week. It was the very
beginning of our group, COINS.

To be honest this group was not created at abhay's house or at my house. Actually it was created at our school PCS. 
It was the real reason for our meet. We all met at our school.That's why I guess giving a bit credit to our school 
won't hurt anyone. We were in 12th class at that time when we decided for our first meet-up. It was not exactly a 
meet-up but it was actually a exam hall (to be more precise,a cheating hall). I was just tired of staying at my house
(Just lockdown things). One day abhay called & said,"Aaj humare exam paper ke answers dhundkr likhna hai. Tu,main aur 
rajil mere naye wale ghar par milege" & I was like finally aaj ghar se kahi bahar masti karunga. Rajil came before time 
and he called me out & at time I was doing something & shouted from inside "Aayaaa!! bhai".
